VixPilot is a project currently in development, aimed at automating trading strategies on the VIX (Volatility Index). 
The core of the trading strategy is mean reversion, which seeks to capitalise on price movements that tend to revert
to a long-term average. The goal of VixPilot is to automate the trading of VIX options, futures, or ETFs, 
reducing human intervention and executing trades based on data-driven insights.
