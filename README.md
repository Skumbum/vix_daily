VixPilot
VixPilot is a project currently in development, aimed at automating trading strategies on the VIX (Volatility Index). 
The core of the trading strategy is mean reversion, which seeks to capitalize on price movements that tend to revert
to a long-term average. The goal of VixPilot is to automate the trading of VIX options, futures, or ETFs, 
reducing human intervention and executing trades based on data-driven insights.

Key Features:
Mean Reversion Strategy: The core strategy used to identify trade opportunities based on price deviation from a historical mean.

Real-time market data retrieval for the VIX

Backtesting capabilities to evaluate the effectiveness of the mean reversion strategy
